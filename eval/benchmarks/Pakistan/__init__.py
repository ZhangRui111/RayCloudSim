cpu_freq are in MIPS / 1000, that's mean in tousend instruction par second and are the multiplication of tyhe number of cores and the frequency of the cores cpu_freq = cores * freq
The task size is in kb
The bandwidth is in kbps
The deadline is in second


Some adjustments are made to the original dataset and simulation to fit the simulation environment and made it more realistic.
